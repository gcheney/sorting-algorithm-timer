# Sorting Algorithm Timer

This project is a command-line application for comparing the speed of popular sorting algorithms. This could also be used as a sorting algorithm utility library. The user is prompted to select a number, which determines the algorithm that will be used to sort a very large array of numbers. The app times this process, determines if the array is indeed sorted, and outputs the result to the console. It also prints the sorted result to a standard text file.
